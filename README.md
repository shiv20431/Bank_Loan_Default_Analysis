This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow—from loading and cleaning raw datasets in Python, to performing SQL-based analysis, and finally building interactive dashboards in Power BI.
It is designed as a practical, real‑world example of how data engineers and analysts transform raw data into meaningful insights.
The workflow includes:
- Importing and exploring datasets using Python
- Cleaning, transforming, and validating data
- Running analytical SQL queries on MySQL/SQL Server
- Designing interactive dashboards in Power BI
- Documenting insights and recommendations
